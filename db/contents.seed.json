      "Text": "Husk database is an embedded, object-oriented data store which uses Go to interact with records. It is meant to be used by small webservices which fully control the data it hosts. This engine attempts to force users to keep business logic close to their required objects, and minimizes entry points and chances for loop holes. ie. when a developer accesses or modifies data outside of the intended scope. This includes many sources. Directly modifying data via an external tool. (SQL Server Management Studio, WorkBench, Toad, etc.) Able to access core Database API in higher-level code, rather than the Logic Layer as intended. (Front-end, Public facing API End-points) Editing the data file directly. Creation timestamps sort records internally, and thereafter their traditional ID. The 'Key' is created from the combination of timestamp and id '0`0'. The Key allows the index to sort the records by creation date, by default. This creates faster access to the most recent records and removes need for sorting after every query. The database engine works similar to ISAM, as it stores data on a sequential tape which lives on disk and held in memory. Husk uses an index with pointers to the actual location on the tape for faster access.",
